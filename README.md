# Azure Resume

This project involved building a digital resume hosted on Microsoft Azure, leveraging several powerful cloud services to create a robust and scalable web application. The primary components used in this project were Azure Blob Storage, Azure Functions, Azure Cosmos DB, and GitHub Actions.

## Project Overview

The goal of the project was to create a personal webpage that serves as a digital resume, showcasing qualifications and experiences. The implementation focused on using Azure services to ensure high availability, scalability, and cost-effectiveness.

## Services Used

- Azure Blob Storage: This service was used to store the static website files, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Blob Storage is optimized for storing large amounts of unstructured data and provides reliable access from anywhere in the world.
- Azure Functions: These serverless functions were integrated to handle backend logic, such as processing HTTP requests and interacting with the database. Azure Functions allowed for a scalable and cost-efficient way to run code without managing servers.
- Azure Cosmos DB: This fully managed NoSQL database was used to store and manage visitor data. Cosmos DB offers low latency and high availability, making it ideal for real-time applications.
- GitHub Actions: This tool was used to automate the CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) pipeline. GitHub Actions facilitated automatic deployment of the web application whenever changes were made to the codebase, ensuring a streamlined and efficient development process

## Benefits of the Project

- Hands-on Experience: Completing this project provided practical experience with several key Azure services, enhancing cloud architecture and web development skills.
- Scalability and Reliability: By leveraging Azure's cloud infrastructure, the digital resume can handle varying levels of traffic and provide consistent performance and availability.
- Cost Efficiency: Using serverless technologies like Azure Functions and pay-as-you-go services like Blob Storage and Cosmos DB helps minimize costs while maintaining high performance.
- Automation and Efficiency: The integration of GitHub Actions for CI/CD allowed for continuous deployment and testing, improving collaboration and reducing time to market.
